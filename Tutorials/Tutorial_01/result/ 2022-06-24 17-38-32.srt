Hi, let me introduce you to 'Pywinauto recorder'.

2
15:38:39,453 --> 15:38:43,640
Go to pywinauto-recorder dot read the docs dot io

3
15:38:48,774 --> 15:38:51,836
"Pywinauto recorder" is a great tool!

4
15:38:52,266 --> 15:38:56,516
It can record user actions and saves them in a Python script.

5
15:38:56,946 --> 15:39:02,646
Then the saved Python script can be run to replay the user actions previously recorded.

6
15:39:03,413 --> 15:39:13,550
"Pywinauto recorder" is a unique "record-replay" tool in the open source field because it generates reliable scripts without hard-coded coordinates thanks to Pywinauto.

7
15:39:14,030 --> 15:39:21,418
Pywinauto is a library that uses accessibility technologies allowing you to automate almost any type of GUI.

8
15:39:21,898 --> 15:39:29,223
The functions of the generated Python script return Pywinauto wrappers so it can be enhanced with Pywinauto methods.

9
15:39:29,993 --> 15:39:31,555
Let's get started!

10
15:39:31,985 --> 15:39:37,598
Download Pywinauto recorder installer for 64-bit Windows on this web page

11
15:39:38,328 --> 15:39:40,603
Click on this download button.

12
15:39:41,449 --> 15:39:44,336
Run Pywinauto recorder installer.

13
15:40:07,825 --> 15:40:11,825
When you run Pywinauto Recorder it starts with this window.

14
15:40:12,255 --> 15:40:14,530
It contains useful information.

15
15:40:15,060 --> 15:40:20,322
All actions can be triggered by a keyboard shortcut or by clicking in the tray menu.

16
15:40:20,802 --> 15:40:24,190
This window is closed my moving the mouse outside.

17
15:40:25,278 --> 15:40:27,915
Now It is running in inspection mode.

18
15:40:28,333 --> 15:40:39,320
In this mode represented by the magnifying glass icon displayed in the top left corner of the screen, Pywinauto Recorder colors green the UI element it can identify under the mouse cursor.

19
15:40:40,102 --> 15:40:50,239
The mouse cursor can be moved around the installer and Pywinauto recorder shows UI element information in real time based on what UI element the cursor is hovering over.

20
15:40:56,913 --> 15:41:06,588
For instance this progress bar is interesting because Pywinauto recorder informs you that you can use a Pywinauto method to retrieve the progress percentage.

21
15:41:19,419 --> 15:41:23,419
To start recording my next actions I press 'alt' 'control' 'r'.

22
15:41:25,743 --> 15:41:27,230
Now it's recording!

23
15:41:28,881 --> 15:41:32,456
Then I'm going to start calculator to do a little addition.

24
15:41:41,771 --> 15:41:42,396
One

25
15:41:44,095 --> 15:41:44,657
Plus

26
15:41:46,408 --> 15:41:47,120
Two

27
15:41:48,706 --> 15:41:50,143
Equals Three

28
15:41:50,986 --> 15:41:53,673
Finally, I close the calculator

29
15:41:54,362 --> 15:41:57,487
I press 'alt' 'control' 'r' to stop recording.

30
15:41:58,324 --> 15:42:01,449
And click on Start playing in the tray menu.

31
15:42:07,447 --> 15:42:09,009
Now it's replaying.

32
15:42:32,234 --> 15:42:37,309
The generated file is in 'Pywinauto Recorder' folder under your home folder.

33
15:42:52,249 --> 15:42:56,286
Let's open the file that was just created to see what it looks like.

34
15:43:01,748 --> 15:43:05,323
You can see that it is an easy to read Python script.

35
15:43:06,094 --> 15:43:09,156
The functions return Pywinauto wrappers.

36
15:43:09,441 --> 15:43:13,028
I'm going to call draw outline on some of these wrappers

37
15:43:13,696 --> 15:43:18,508
The first draw outline will display a red rectangle around the One button.

38
15:43:22,382 --> 15:43:26,744
The second one will display a green rectangle around the Plus button.

39
15:43:31,283 --> 15:43:35,720
And the third one will display a blue rectangle around the Two button.

40
15:43:37,779 --> 15:43:39,266
Let's replay it!

41
15:43:54,317 --> 15:43:57,204
Now Pywinauto recorder is replaying.

42
15:43:57,684 --> 15:44:01,872
You can see the Replay icon in the top left corner of the screen.

43
15:44:02,302 --> 15:44:09,927
The actions we recorded in the Python script have been replayed and the three draw outline functions we've just added have been called.

44
15:44:10,596 --> 15:44:12,158
Thanks for watching!

45
15:44:12,651 --> 15:44:17,463
In the next tutorial, you will see how to make a robust recorded script.

46
15:44:17,956 --> 15:44:19,443
See you soon!
