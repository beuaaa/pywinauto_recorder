Contributing to development
---------------------------

If you want to deep dive and help out with development on Pywinauto recorder, then
first get the project installed locally. After that is done we
suggest you have a look at tickets in our issue tracker that are labelled `Good
First Issue`_. These are meant to be a great way to get a smooth start and
won't put you in front of the most complex parts of the system.

If you are up to more challenging tasks with a bigger scope,
then there are a set of tickets with a `Feature`_ or `Improvement`_ tag.
These tickets have a general overview and description of the work required to finish.
If you want to start somewhere, this would be a good place to start
(make sure that the issue also have the `Accepted`_ label).
That said, these aren't necessarily the easiest tickets.
They are simply things that are explained.
If you still didn't find something to work on, search for the `Sprintable`_ label.
Those tickets are meant to be standalone and can be worked on ad-hoc.

You can read all of our :doc:`/development/index` to understand more the development of Pywinauto recorder. When contributing code, then please follow the standard Contribution Guidelines set forth at `contribution-guide.org`_.
