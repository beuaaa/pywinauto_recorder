Description
===========

"Pywinauto recorder" records user interface actions and saves them in a Python script.
The saved Python script can be run to replay the user interface actions previously recorded.

"Pywinauto recorder" is a unique inspect/record/replay tool in the open source field because it generates reliable scripts without hard-coded coordinates thanks to Pywinauto_.

Pywinauto_ is a library that uses accessibility technologies allowing you to automate almost any type of GUI:
MFC, VB6, VCL, simple WinForms controls and most of the old legacy apps, WinForms, WPF, Store apps, Qt, and browsers.

The functions of the generated Python script return Pywinauto_ wrappers so it can be enhanced with Pywinauto methods_.
